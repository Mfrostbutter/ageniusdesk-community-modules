"""The in-process read toolset the fleet agents use over the n8n fleet.

Agent Fleet runs in_process (Option A), so each tool calls the owning AgeniusDesk
module directly rather than going out over HTTP. Each tool is `async def` and the
graph's agent node is async too, so the whole loop stays on the event loop with no
run_coroutine_threadsafe gymnastics.

These imports reach `backend.*`. That is expected for an in_process community
module (see CONTRIBUTING): there is no sandbox in_process, so the module really
does call host internals, and the static scanner flags it as a host-import HIGH.
The tool docstrings are the spec the model sees; keep them tight and read-only.
